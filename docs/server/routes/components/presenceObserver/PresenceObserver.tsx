to determine if the user is present at the \`location\`.

Cord marks presence and absence based on JavaScript events like
\`mouseenter\`. To do this, Cord uses a set of default event
listeners that cover the majority of cases. You may find that
you need to set additional event listeners to correctly capture
a user's presence within your app.

For each event type you list, Cord will automatically create an
event listener (by calling \`addEventListener(<event type>, ()
=> { ... })\`). When these events fire, Cord will pick up the
event and mark the user as present in the current location.

Example: \`['scroll', 'mousemove']\`.

The default is set to \`['mouseenter', 'focusin']\`.`,
              },

For each event type you list, Cord will automatically create an
event listener (by calling \`addEventListener(<event type>, ()
=> { ... })\`). When these events fire, Cord will pick up the
event and mark the user as absent in the current location.

The default is set to \`['mouseleave', 'focusout']\`.`,

                type: 'boolean',
                description: `A \`true\` or \`false\` value to tell Cord whether
or not the viewing user is present in the \`location\`.

This is necessary if the user is present at page load but may
not yet have triggered any of the "present" DOM events that
would cause them to be marked as present. For example, if the
user loads a page, but doesn't move their mouse or use their
keyboard, Cord will not automatically know that they're present
on the page.

\`<PresenceObserver>\` elements in the page and you want to
surface that the user is present in a particular one at page load.`,

or not the current document is visible, rather than based on the
"present" and "absent" DOM events. Setting this to \`true\` means
that \`presentEvents\`, \`absentEvents\`, and \`initialState\`
value will be ignored.

The main situation in which you'd want to use this property is
when other events (like cursor and keyboard events) are not
capturing user presence accurately. A common case here is on
very short pages where the majority of the visible screen is
an empty window. In these situations, you may find that the
user doesn't generate any mouse events since their cursor
isn't within the <body> element.

In the majority of such cases, you should consider using the
\`<PagePresence>\` component instead, because it provides both
a \`<PresenceObserver>\` and a \`<PresenceFacepile>\` in a
single component.

You may still want a \`<PresenceObserver>\` with \`observeDocument\`
set to \`true\` if you want to record presence on a page but not
surface it. That is to say â€“ you want to observe presence, but
you don't want to show a facepile. This is sometimes the case
when you want to record presence in one place but surface it in another place.

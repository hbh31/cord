          ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before December 2023, authentication worked a little differently.
          Previously, we required client tokens to be signed with group (org)
          IDs. We now recommend omitting this for a more flexible user
          experience. The old approach continues to be supported. See{' '}

        <p>
          üí° This page gives the details behind authentication. Our server
          libraries have functions for generating auth tokens, which abstract
          away these details. We recommend using those libraries, unless your
          backend uses a language for which we don't offer a server library.

        <H3>Background</H3>
        <p>
          All authentication in Cord uses{' '}
          <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a> (JWTs). A JWT consists
          of a JSON <i>payload</i>, plus a cryptographic signature generated
          using a <i>secret</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The payload contains information from the JWT signer that the verifier
          needs. We use two different payloads: one for client auth tokens and
          another for server auth tokens, so as to include only the information
          we need in each context.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find your secret in the{' '}
          <a href="https://console.cord.com/projects">Cord console</a>; use it
          to sign all JWTs you send to Cord.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must generate all tokens on your backend. From there, you'll send
          client auth tokens to your frontend, and server auth tokens directly
          to Cord's servers.
        </p>
        <EmphasisCard>
          <p>
            ‚ö†Ô∏è Store your secret securely on your servers. Don't share it with
            anyone, and don't include it in client code.

        <H3>Signing</H3>
        <p>
          Sign all JWTs using the <code>HS512</code> (HMAC with SHA-512)
          algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          JWTs include an expiration time. For security, you should set the
          expiration of your JWTs to a short interval. Our recommendation is 1
          minute, which very safely accounts for any network delays and clock
          skew.

          you'll need to verify JWTs that Cord's servers send to your servers.
          They will be signed with your secret, using <code>HS256</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use a JWT library for your language to verify the JWTs you receive
          before doing anything with their contents.
